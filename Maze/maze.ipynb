    "A heuristic method to find the shortest path between the source (upper-left corner) and a target vertex in a random size graph can be a sequence of best moves on each steps to find the suboptimal solution to the problem. The agent starts at the source and finds the best action (move) among the feasible solutions (its neighbours). Because all the possible targets in the grid are on the bottom-right side of the agent, we assume that each cell has just two feasible neighbours which are the right and the bottom cells of the current cell. The agent walks through the grid and in each step it chooses to go to the right or to the bottom, however, it cannot move to a cell where has a location number on the grid greater than the number of the target location based on the grid coordinates (upper-left corner)."
